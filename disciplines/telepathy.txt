__**Telepathy**__

At the highest levels of Auspex the vampire can now literally read minds, as well as project their own thoughts into the minds of others. While reading a mortal mind is relatively straightforward, undead minds requires a higher effort to penetrate.

**■ Cost:** One Rouse Check (plus one Willpower vs non-consenting vampires)

**■ Dice Pools:** Resolve + Auspex vs Wits + Subterfuge

**■ System:** The user is not required to roll any dice to project their thoughts to another, vampire or mortal, though they do require line of sight. To read the mind of a mortal within line of sight, roll Resolve + Auspex vs Wits + Subterfuge while looking into their eyes. (Unless the mortal consents, in which case no roll is required.) A win means that the user can discern surface thoughts as a stream of images, with higher margin allowing the user to probe for more distant or buried memories. A critical win gives a coherent picture of the subject’s current thoughts and intentions. To read the mind of a non-consenting vampire, spend one Willpower point before rolling.

**■ Duration:** Roughly one minute per Rouse Check. Increased to a full scene on consenting subjects.
