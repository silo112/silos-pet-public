__**Majesty**__

At this pinnacle of the Discipline the vampire can amplify their countenance to supernatural levels. Whether they appear as heartrendingly beautiful, monstrously terrifying, or wielding absolute command, everyone who views them is struck by their image, unable to act or even speak against the vampire. To experience Majesty is to be in the presence of the divine - or the infernal.

**■ Cost:** Two Rouse Checks

**■ Dice Pools:** Charisma + Presence vs Composure + Resolve

**■ System:** People in the presence of the user can only stare, slackjawed, or avert their eyes in fear or submission. Anyone wanting to act in any way in opposition to the user, except for selfpreservation, must successfully win a contest of their Composure + Resolve vs. the vampire’s Charisma + Presence. A win allows one turn of freedom, plus one per point of margin; only a critical win resists the effect for the entire scene.

**■ Duration:** One scene
