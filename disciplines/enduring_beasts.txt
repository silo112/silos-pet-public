__**Enduring Beasts**__

**■ Amalgam:** Animalism 1

The user shares a small portion of their unnatural toughness with the animals they influence. Teeming swarms and great beasts alike exhibit a resistance to fleeting injuries almost equal to the vampire themself.

**■ Cost:** Free (for famulus); One Rouse Check (for other animals)

**■ Dice Pools:** Stamina + Animalism (for non-famulus animals)

**■ System:** The vampire can choose to extend some of their Fortitude powers to animals affected by their Animalism. Any animal thus imbued gains additional Health levels equal to the Fortitude dots of the vampire. Using this power on their famulus is free and automatic. To imbue other animals besides their famulus, the user must make a Rouse Check and roll a test of Stamina + Animalism (Difficulty 3). The user can fortify one animal per point of margin. When the effect ends, remove unmarked Health first; this may result in the animal expiring.

**■ Duration:** One Scene
