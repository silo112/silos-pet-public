__**Flesh of Marble**__

The power of the Blood causes the skin of the vampire to harden, taking on a marble-like sheen that  is still supple but stops almost any blow before momentarily breaking and reforming. A vampire using this power is almost impossible to destroy outright, barring a lucky blow or physical restraint.

**■ Cost:** Two Rouse Checks

**■ System:** With this power active, the vampire ignores the first source of physical damage each turn, including fire but not sunlight. If confusion arises about which source is “first,” the Storyteller either decides based on the narrative, or the vampire ignores the most damaging single source that turn. A critical win on an attack roll bypasses this power.

**■ Duration:** One scene
