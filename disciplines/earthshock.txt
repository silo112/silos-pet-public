__**Earthshock**__

Their strength an elemental force, the vampire can slam their fist or foot into the ground, creating a shockwave that throws their opponents prone. One of the more dramatic applications of Potence, this power needs to be carefully employed, lest the user literally bring the house down upon themselves.

**■ Cost:** Two Rouse Checks

**■ System:** No additional test is needed to create the shockwave. (The ground is hard to miss.) Anyone within a fivemeter radius of the user must make a Dexterity + Athletics roll (Difficulty 3), with the results below. Anyone prepared for the Earthshock (such as the user’s companions) can shift their results up by one step.

◻ Critical Win: No effect.

◻ Win: Knocked off balance. Lose current action

◻ Failure: Fall prone. Lose current action; must spend a turn getting up. This power causes significant collateral damage. If used on the ground, the earth cracks. If used indoors, furniture breaks and mirrors shatter. On anything but the ground floor the floor might shatter, causing everyone within the radius to plummet to the floor below. This power can only be used once per scene.

**■ Duration:** One use
