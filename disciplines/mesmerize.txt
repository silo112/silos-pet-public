__**Mesmerize**__

The vampire can issue complex commands to a victim, as long as they have the subject’s gaze and relative quiet in which to issue instructions. The instructions must be carried out immediately to the victim’s best ability, and must not contain any conditional actions (“...if you see Henry, give him the document”), as this would require the victim to exercise cognition.

**■ Cost:** One Rouse Check

**■ Dice Pools:** Manipulation + Dominate vs Intelligence + Resolve

**■ System:** No roll is required against an unprepared mortal victim. Commanding a resisting victim or another vampire requires a contest of Manipulation + Dominate vs Intelligence + Resolve. Commands that go against the victim’s nature also require such a contest.

**■ Duration:** Until the command is carried out or the scene ends, whichever comes first.
