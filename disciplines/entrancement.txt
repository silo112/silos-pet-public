__**Entrancement**__

The vampire focuses their unnatural allure on a single person, instilling in them a rapt fascination or infatuation akin to falling head over heels in love or meeting one’s lifelong idol. The person affected does their best to remain in the vampire’s good graces, but stops short of causing themselves or their other loved ones physical harm.

**■ Cost:** One Rouse Check

**■ Dice Pools:** Charisma + Presence vs Composure + Wits

**■ System:** The vampire only needs to gain the subject’s attention and win a contest of Charisma + Presence vs Composure + Wits. The effect lasts for roughly one hour plus one per point of margin on the win. The vampire can renew this effect indefinitely, but a failure ends the effect and makes the subject immune for the rest of the night. After succeeding, the user adds dice equal to their Presence rating to any Social dice pool against the entranced subject. Requests resulting in obvious harm to the subject or their loved ones, or that oppose the subject’s Tenets, fail and require an immediate power contest roll as above, or the Entrancement immediately fails.

**■ Duration:** One hour plus one per point of margin
