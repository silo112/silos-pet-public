__**Awe**__

Anyone in the presence of the vampire finds their attention inexplicably drawn to them. Those listening to the vampire speak might suddenly agree on subjects where they once held different viewpoints. While this power doesn’t cause rapt infatuation, it is still strong enough to sway the minds of most mortals.

**■ Cost:** Free

**■ Dice Pools:** Manipulation + Presence vs Composure + Intelligence

**■ System:** Add the Presence rating to any Skill roll involving Persuasion or Performance as well as to other Charismarelated rolls, at the Storyteller’s discretion. Anyone aware that they’re being affected can try to resist with a contest of Composure + Intelligence vs the user’s Manipulation + Presence. On a win, the target can resist the effects for one scene; a critical win makes the target immune for the entire night. Once the power wears off, victims revert to their previous opinions.

**■ Duration:** One scene or until intentionally ended
