__**Draught Of Might**__

The Blood of the vampire becomes saturated with the power of Potence, conveying a part of that power to anyone who drinks of it. This is the Potence equivalent of Draught of Elegance (p. 254).

**■ Cost:** One Rouse Check

**■ System:** Drinking a Rouse Checks worth of Blood directly from the user gifts the drinker with temporary Potence equal to half the Potence dots (rounded down) of the donor. The drinker gains the same powers as the donor’s, up to that level.

**■ Duration:** One night; for vampires, until the next feeding or the vampire reaches Hunger 5
