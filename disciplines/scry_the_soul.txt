__**Scry the Soul**__

By focusing on a person, the vampire can perceive the state of that person’s psyche as a shifting aura of colors. Auras reveal little precise information, but do provide clues regarding many subjects, e.g., emotional state, Resonance, and supernatural traits. If looking for a specific condition, the vampire can cursorily scan the crowd to detect it. Such cursory scans provide no further information.

**■ Cost:** One Rouse Check

**■ Dice Pools:** Intelligence + Auspex vs Composure + Subterfuge

**■ System:** Make an Intelligence + Auspex vs Composure + Subterfuge roll. On a win, the Storyteller truthfully answers a number of questions equal to the margin of the roll about the target’s aura and psyche, including:

◻ The emotional state of the subject
◻ The Resonance in the subject’s blood
◻ Whether the subject is a vampire, werewolf, ghoul or any other supernatural being
◻ Whether the subject is under the influence of Blood Sorcery or other magic
◻ Whether the subject has committed diablerie in the last year
◻ A critical win allows discovery of something unexpected, as determined by the Storyteller If scanning a crowd, roll versus a Difficulty determined by the size of the crowd and external distractions, as well as the type of trait being sought. (Finding the vampire in the living room might only be a Difficulty 3, while finding the most nervous person at a crowded rave is most likely Difficulty 6 or higher.)

**■ Duration:** One turn, or Storyteller’s discretion
