__**Quell the Beast**__

By locking eyes with a target, the vampire cows their inner Beast into temporary slumber. Mortals affected thus become apathetic, unable to take any actions other than to stay alive, while vampires bestial urges temporarily abate, for better or worse.

**■ Cost:** One Rouse Check

**■ Dice Pools:** Charisma + Animalism vs Stamina + Resolve

**■ System:** Roll Charisma + Animalism vs Stamina + Resolve. A win against a mortal target incapacitates them for that scene, instilling severe lethargy. They act only to preserve themselves, not against the user or anyone else. A win against a vampire prevents the target from performing Blood Surges. While their Beast is quelled, vampires do not score messycriticals. Against vampires, this power lasts a turn plus a number of turns equal to the win margin on the contest. A critical win against a vampire target also ends their frenzy.

**■ Duration:** One scene, or a number of turns equal to the test margin plus one.
