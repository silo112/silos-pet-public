__**Baals Caress**__

The vampire can transmute their Blood into an extremely aggressive poison, lethal to mortal and Kindred alike.

**■ Cost:** One or more Rouse Checks

**■ Dice Pools:** Strength + Blood Sorcery vs Stamina + Occult or Fortitude

**■ System:** This power uses the same system (and its poison has the same restrictions) as Scorpion’s Touch (p. 273), with increased damage. If the poison hits, the user rolls a contest of Strength + Blood Sorcery vs Stamina + Occult. (Vampires with Fortitude may resist with Fortitude in lieu of the Occult Skill.) If the user wins, the poison does the margin in Aggravated Health damage to mortals and vampires alike. A mortal who takes even one point of damage dies instantly. If a vampire target takes Aggravated damage from this poison, the user rolls the contest again; on a win, the vampire enters torpor when next they go to sleep.

**■ Duration:** The poison remains potent for one scene
