__**Daunt**__

Instead of attracting people, the vampire uses Presence to repel. With this power the user appears threatening and exudes an aura of menace powerful enough to make most mortals avoid their attention and even vampires think twice about acting against them.

**■ Cost:** Free

**■ System:** Add the user’s Presence rating to any Intimidation rolls. Attacking the user requires a Resolve+Composure roll at Difficulty 2. Vampires cannot use Awe and Daunt simultaneously.

**■ Duration:** One scene or until intentionally ended
