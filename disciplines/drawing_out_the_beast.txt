__**Drawing out the Beast**__

The vampire can project their Beast at the moment of terror or fury frenzy, transferring it into a nearby subject, either mortal or vampire. That person immediately experiences the frenzy instead, going on a merciless rampage or fleeing in terror depending on the trigger.

**■ Cost:** One Rouse Check

**■ Dice Pools:** Wits + Animalism vs Composure + Resolve

**■ System:** Instead of the Willpower roll to resist a terror or fury frenzy, roll Wits + Animalism vs Composure + Resolve of the target. If the user fails, they enter frenzy as though they had failed the Willpower roll. On a win, the target experiences that frenzy instead of the user. Later stimuli can still provoke frenzy in the user, but they can use this power as long as they can make Rouse Checks and fur - ther targets remain available. This power cannot transfer a hunger frenzy.

**■ Duration:** Frenzy duration (see p. 220)
