__**Unseen Passage**__

With this power, the vampire can now move around while staying hidden. The user is functionally invisible, per the usual Obfuscate limitations.

**■ Cost:** One Rouse Check

**■ System:** As long as the user emits no overpowering odors and no sound louder than a whisper, this power automatically works. Only if the observer has their attention drawn to the user can they make a detection roll. Sense the Unseen (Auspex 1) can also detect the hidden vampire, as per the general Obfuscate rules. Note that the user cannot use this power to disappear while being actively observed; it automatically fails in such a case.

**■ Duration:** One scene or until detection.
