__**Blink**__

The vampire swiftly closes in on a foe, engaging or escaping in the blink of an eye. To an unprepared observer the user almost appears  to teleport, a rush of wind the only sign of their passing.

**■ Cost:** One Rouse Check

**■ Dice Pools:** Dexterity + Athletics, or as needed

**■ System:** The vampire moves in a straight line toward a target, covering any distance under 50 meters while still having enough time to perform an action, such as an attack, during the turn. If the terrain is in any way hazardous, the character needs to make a Dexterity + Athletics roll to avoid stumbling and coming to a halt on the way. The Storyteller may call for other contests as desired, especially if the vampire races a distant foe to an object or an action. Vampires engaging a foe with this power act as if already engaged when the turn begins.

**■ Duration:** One turn
