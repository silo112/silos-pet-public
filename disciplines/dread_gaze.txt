__**Dread Gaze**__

Briefly exposing their vampiric nature, the user instills a single subject with utter terror. Mortals are cowed, run, or freeze with fear, while other vampires either submit like whipped dogs or flee in frenzied Rötschreck.

**■ Cost:** One Rouse Check

**■ Dice Pools:** Charisma + Presence vs Composure + Resolve

**■ System:** Displaying their fangs, their face twisted in a predatory grimace, the user rolls a contest of Charisma + Presence against their target’s Composure + Resolve.

◻ Failure: Mortals are unable to act other than in their own defense, backing off for a turn. Vampires are unaffected.

◻ Win: Mortals run in fear. Vampires are unable to act other than in their own defense for a turn unless they spend Willpower equal to the users margin of win (to a minimum of one). ◻ Critical Win: Mortals freeze or crumple into a fetal position. Vampires must make a terror frenzy  test (Difficulty 3). If they win, they are still affected as above.

**■ Duration:** One turn
