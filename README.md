Public version of my simples text-based Discord Bot

This is a simple bot, my first ever coding experiment, made for a VTM V5 RP server. There are the -reset and -reboot functions that send messages in RP channels for channel reset, these functions work only in a specific channel and only when the channel admins use it.

There is an additional function. In a specific channel, people can enter the name of v5 disciplines as commands and the bot returns the entire entry about that specific discipline.

When active, this specific bot ran on Heroku.
